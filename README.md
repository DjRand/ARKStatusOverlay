# ARKStatusOverlay
 A simple overlay app for ARK Survival Ascended to see your server's status.

# TODO:
 Next update I'll probably change sever selection a bit to streamline things.

# Installation:
 This requires node.js and electron.

 For node package manager, you'd need to install electron, asa-query, soundplay
 
 If you're using Windows 64bit, I have a portable .exe on the release page: https://github.com/DjRand/ARKStatusOverlay/releases/tag/Release
